## 1. Materials

#### Flaps: HIPS

HIPS appeared to have all the ideal properties for being the flaps. It is lightweight, impact-resistant, and makes the perfect split flap noise when impacting another flap.



#### Outer casing: Perspex

Perspex was chosen as it allows people to look inside the module and see how it works, as well as the flaps from behind. This was purely an aesthetic choice.



#### Base structure: MDF

The base structure isn't intended to be seen by anyone, so MDF was chosen due to its strength and low cost.



#### Base front: Alder

The front of the base will always be seen, so a high quality wood was chosen. The wood patterns also give it a fairly vintage look which matches the intended style.



#### Rod: Steel

A steel rod was chosen to hold the spool in place. It is easily lubricated as well as being very strong, which makes it ideal to be used as a moving part.



#### Spool: MDF

MDF was chosen due to the low cost. It was also spray-painted black to match the colour of the flaps.



#### Front panel: MDF

The front panel also had to be black in order to match the flaps (and make the white letters really stand out), so MDF was once again chosen.
